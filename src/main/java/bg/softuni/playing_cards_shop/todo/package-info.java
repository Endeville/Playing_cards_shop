package bg.softuni.playing_cards_shop.todo;

//todo-s:
//1. add nothing found to all the listing pages(catalog, offers, cart, orders etc.)


//2. forget the request part. We will make the following:
//-every user will be able to send a request asking for the admin to add something(kind of like report system)
//-then the admin receive it in his requests page and approve it or decline it -> creating the required work
//-everything is awesome
